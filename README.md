# 🌍 Geographic Barriers to Vaccine: Associations of Travel Time with COVID-19 Vaccine Uptake and Perceived Availability in Kenya

## 📋 Overview
This research investigates how travel time affects COVID-19 vaccine availability perception and uptake in Kenya. Using geospatial analysis and survey data, we examine the relationship between physical accessibility of vaccination sites and vaccination outcomes, while considering the moderating role of trust in government.

## 🔍 Key Findings
- ⏰ 55% of Kenyans lived within 30 minutes of a vaccination site
- 🚗 21.6% faced travel times exceeding 120 minutes
- 📊 Vaccine availability perception reached its lowest (39.5%) at 182.7 minutes travel time
- 💉 Vaccine uptake dropped to 14% at 121.6 minutes travel time
- 🤝 Trust in government significantly moderated the effect of travel time on outcomes

## 📊 Data
- 🗺️ Travel times calculated from 258 constituency centroids to 811 vaccination sites
- 📝 Cross-sectional survey data from 1,436 respondents (October–December 2021)
- 📍 High-resolution geospatial data for cost path distance calculation

## 🔬 Methods
- ⚡ Cost path distance algorithm for travel time calculation
- 📈 Multivariate logistic regression analysis
- 📉 Quadratic modeling for nonlinear relationships
- 🔄 Interaction models for trust moderation effects
